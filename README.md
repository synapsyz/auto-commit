# auto-commit 🚀

Turn your code changes into professional Git history in milliseconds.

**auto-commit** is a lightweight, AI-powered CLI utility designed for developers who value clean project history but hate the manual overhead of writing commit logs. Powered by Groq's LPU hardware and Llama 3, it analyzes your staged changes and "forges" a professional, **Conventional Commit-compliant** message instantly.

## ✨ Why use auto-commit?

* ⚡ **Blazing Fast:** Generates messages in under 500ms using Groq's LPU.
* 🧠 **Context Aware:** Reads your git diff to understand why changes were made.
* 📝 **Standardized:** Enforces Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, etc.).
* 💰 **100% Free:** Runs on the Groq free tier API.
* 🔒 **Privacy Focused:** Your API key is stored locally on your machine.
* 🛠️ **Automated Setup:** Includes a self-install script that handles dependencies and aliases.
